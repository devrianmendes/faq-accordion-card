Faq accordion card challenge from frontendmentor

My attemtp to solve this challenge from frontendmentor.
In this project, i used css and javascript without any library/framework and use eslint airbnb style to revise the code.

One thing i couldn't do and was the illustration-box-desktop.svg alone overflowing the parent box. Accepting tips :D
Good coding for you all.
